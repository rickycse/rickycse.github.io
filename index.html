          <h3>Q. Tell me about yourself!</h3>
          <p>
            Hi I'm Ricky! I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at York
            University, currently interning as a Software Engineer at RBC. I
            previously worked at TD as a "Quality Engineer Intern" and a small
            startup called MyRide901 as a Software Engineer Intern.
            <br /><br />
            On my spare time I like to play video games, read comics, and tinker
            with my new 3D printer! I can't say no to a game of chess and I also
            enjoy going to the gym and working out, but I don't do it as often
            as I should.
            <br /><br />
            My end goal is a little hard to describe, but I'd like to be a
            reliable software engineer with all the skills and good habits I
            imagined when I first started computer science.

        <h3>Q. What made you choose to go to York?</h3>

            <h4>BSc Hons. Computer Science at York University</h4>
            <div class="sub-desc">Sep 2021 - Present</div>
            <p class="text">
              Honestly, it was between going to York or going to TMU for
              Computer Science. I chose York because I heard that the Computer
              Science program was better than TMU's (still not sure if this is
              true) and I was really inspired by
              <a href="https://chrisnguyn.github.io/york-cs-primer/"
                >Christopher Nguyen's story.</a
              >
              <br /><br />
              I pretty much knew I wanted to do Computer Science since I was in
              high school. I really liked my computer science classes and I
              thought software engineers were experts who just knew everything-
              and I wanted to be like that too.

              <br /><br />
              The only thing that sucked when I started university was that it
              was all online thanks to COVID-19. I didn't get to meet any of my
              classmates or professors in person until 2nd year and all the
              hackathons I wanted to go to were all online. Regardless, I did
              meet some really cool people later down the road that I'm still
              friends with to this day (hey Gurpreet, hey Bryan lol).

            <h4>Software Engineer Intern at MyRide901</h4>
            <div class="sub-desc">Markham, ON - 3 Months</div>
            <div class="text">
              This was my first internship and I can't even describe how lucky I
              was. After 500+ applications (some to the U.S), I thought it was
              time to give up once June crept in, but then I got an email from
              the co-op program saying a small startup was looking for interns.
              I applied, got an interview, and got the job! I got to wear a lot
              of hats, so I was doing everything from frontend work, writing
              some scripts for data reporting, and some backend work. Although
              it was a short internship, I learned a lot about what software
              engineers actually do and a little bit about how startups worked.

            <h4>Machine Learning Intern at TD Bank</h4>
            <div class="sub-desc">Toronto, ON - 4 Months</div>
            <div class="text">
              Lady luck smiled on me once again and I somehow landed an
              internship at TD Bank for Winter 2023. On paper, I was a "Quality
              Engineer Intern" but oddly enough, I spent the entire 4 months
              building and testing machine learning models. I ended up learning
              a lot about machine learning, a little bit about AI/ML industry,
              and even got to present my work to a bunch of different teams to
              have it adopted across the department. I also met a lot of really
              cool people along the way (hey Isaac, sup Pravin). Overall, I
              really enjoyed my time at TD and I felt like it took me a solid
              step forward in becoming a good engineer.

            <h4>Software Engineer Intern at RBC</h4>
            <div class="sub-desc">Toronto, ON - 12 Months</div>
            <div class="text">
              My most unexpected surprise was getting an internship at RBC for
              Fall 2024. I applied to some positions thinking, "there's no way
              RBC would hire me." Well, an OA and short interview later, I got
              the position! I was really excited to work at RBC because of all
              the good things I kept hearing about the mentorship, culture, and
              work. It was a little daunting to hear that I'd be staying for a
              full year, but I would say that its been well worth it. Getting
              to see how software engineers work day-to-day fully confirmed for
              me that this was what I wanted to do in the future. Working for
              12-months has also been great so far since its allowed me to
              really invest myself into a big project and "own it" in a way. The
              amount of support and mentorship I've received has been honestly
              insane and I feel like I've learned so much in such a short time.
              If I could go back in time and could pick my first co-op, RBC
              would be my first choice.
              <br /><br />
              Little tidbit: One of my highlights so far was accidentally
              becoming a co-op representative for RBC at UoftHacks lol.

              My very first project starting university was a 2D-platformer game
              I made using Python and Pygame. It's kind of like Space Wars but
              horizontal and much simpler. I thought about becoming a game
              developer at first and decided to make a game to test out the
              waters and see if it was a good fit for me or not. I ended up
              realizing that I didn't like game development and that I sucked at
              making game art...

              I don't know what possessed me to take 6 courses at once starting
              university, but I did and I needed a way to keep track of all my
              grades, how much I needed on my finals to pass, and somewhere I
              could set reminders for my assignments. I ended up making a
              Discord bot for all of that and this was the first time I noticed
              how much value I could bring writing code. I originally made the
              project for myself, but I ended up sharing it with some friends
              and they loved it. I plan on revisiting this project later and
              improving it.

            <div class="text">
              My first in-person hackathon! Sleep-deprivation has never hit any
              harder than my time at Hack the North, but it was probably the
              best hackathon I've been to so far. I got to see a lot of amazing
              projects that I didn't even know was possible to make under 36
              hours and I got to hang out with some really cool people
              throughout the event. My team and I ended up re-creating
              Nintendo's DS Pictochat, but with a twistâ€”combining geocaching and
              chat features so users could leave behind or discover messages and
              drawings in real-world locations, all through a browser-based
              experience. Although we didn't win any prizes, it is still one of
              the most memorable weekends I've ever had and honestly, I couldn't
              have asked for a better experience.
