          <h3>Q. Tell me about yourself!</h3>
          <p>
            Hi I'm Ricky! I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at York
            University, currently interning as a Software Engineer at RBC. I
            previously worked at TD as a "Quality Engineer Intern" and a small
            startup called MyRide901 as a Software Engineer Intern.
            <br /><br />
            On my spare time I like to play video games, read comics, and tinker
            with my new 3D printer! I can't say no to a game of chess and I also
            enjoy going to the gym and working out, but I don't do it as often
            as I should (I'm working on it).
            <br /><br />
            My end goal is a little hard to describe, but I'd like to be a
            reliable software engineer with all the skills and good habits I
            imagined when I first started computer science.

            <h4>BSc Hons. Computer Science at York University</h4>
            <div class="sub-desc">Sep 2021 - Present</div>
            <p class="text">
              Honestly, it was between going to York or going to TMU for
              Computer Science. I chose York because I heard that the Computer
              Science program was better than TMU's (still not sure if this is
              true) and I was really inspired by
              <a target="_blank"  href="https://chrisnguyn.github.io/york-cs-primer/"
                >Christopher Nguyen's story.</a
              >
              <br /><br />
              I pretty much knew I wanted to do Computer Science since I was in
              high school. I really liked my computer science classes and I
              thought software engineers were all cracked experts who just
              somehow knew everything— and I wanted to be like that too.

              <br /><br />
              The only thing that bummed me out when I started university was
              that everything was online because of the pandemic, so I didn't
              get to meet any of my classmates or professors in person until
              second year. All the hackathons I wanted to go to were all online
              too. Regardless, I did meet some really cool people later down the
              road that I'm still friends with to this day (hey Gurpreet, hey
              Bryan lol).

            <h4>Software Engineer Intern at MyRide901</h4>
            <div class="sub-desc">Markham, ON - 3 Months</div>
            <div class="text">
              This was my first internship and I can't even describe how lucky I
              was. After 500+ applications (including some to U.S. roles—so the
              number's a little bit inflated) and with June right around the
              corner, I thought it was time to give up. But then I got an email
              from the co-op program saying that a small startup was looking for
              last-minute interns. I applied, got an interview, and got the job!
              I got to wear a lot of hats, so I was doing everything from
              frontend work, writing some scripts for data reporting, and some
              backend work. Although it was a short internship, I learned a lot
              about what software engineers actually do and a little bit about
              how startups worked.

            <h4>Machine Learning Intern at TD Bank</h4>
            <div class="sub-desc">Toronto, ON - 4 Months</div>
            <div class="text">
              Lady luck smiled on me once again and I somehow landed an
              internship at TD Bank for Winter 2023. On paper, I was a "Quality
              Engineer Intern" but oddly enough, I spent the entire 4 months
              building and testing machine learning models. I ended up learning
              a lot about machine learning, a little bit about the AI/ML
              industry, and even got to present my work to a bunch of different
              teams to have it adopted across the department. I also met a lot
              of really cool people along the way (hey Isaac, sup Pravin).
              Overall, I really enjoyed my time at TD and I felt like it took me
              a solid step forward in becoming a good engineer.

            <h4>Software Engineer Intern at RBC</h4>
            <div class="sub-desc">Toronto, ON - 12 Months</div>
            <div class="text">
              My most unexpected surprise was getting an internship at RBC for
              Fall 2024. I applied to some postings thinking, "there's no way
              RBC would hire me." Well, an OA and short interview later, I got
              the job! I was really excited to work at RBC because of all the
              great things I kept hearing about the mentorship, culture, and
              work. It was a little daunting to hear that I'd be staying for a
              full year— but looking back, it was one of the best decisions I've
              made. Working for 12-months has also been great since its allowed
              me to really invest myself into a big project and "own it" in a
              way. I'm now the go-to wizard for it lol. All of the support and
              mentorship I've received along the way has been honestly insane
              and I feel like I've learned so much in such a short time. If I
              could go back in time and pick my first co-op, RBC would be my
              first choice.
              <br /><br />
              Little tidbit: One of my highlights so far was accidentally
              becoming a co-op representative for RBC at UoftHacks lol.

            <div class="text">
              My very first project starting university was a 2D-platformer game
              I made using Python and Pygame. It's kind of like Space Wars but
              simpler and played horizontally. I thought about becoming a game
              developer at first and decided to make a game to test out the
              waters and see if it was a good fit for me or not. I learned two
              things: I don't like game development and I suck at making game
              art...

              I don't know what possessed me to take 6 courses at once starting
              university, but I did and I needed a way to keep track of all my
              grades, how much I needed on my finals to pass, and somewhere I
              could set reminders for my assignments. I ended up making a
              Discord bot for all of that and this was the first time I noticed
              how much value I could bring writing code. I originally made the
              project for myself, but I ended up sharing it with some friends
              and they loved it. I plan on revisiting this project later and
              improving it.

              My first in-person hackathon! Sleep-deprivation has never hit any
              harder than my time at Hack the North, but it was probably the
              best hackathon I've been to so far. I got to see a lot of amazing
              projects that I didn't even know was possible to make under 36
              hours and I got to hang out with some really cool people
              throughout the event. My team and I ended up re-creating
              Nintendo's DS Pictochat, but with a twist—combining geocaching and
              chat features so users could leave behind or discover messages and
              drawings in real-world locations, all through a browser-based
              experience. Although we didn't win any prizes, it is still one of
              the most memorable weekends I've ever had and honestly, I couldn't
              have asked for a better experience.

              I recently got into 3D printing and thought I'd make a guide for

              the different printers to choose from when you're starting out,
              the filaments you'll need to print with, safety steps,
              troubleshooting, and more. I plan to add more features to this to
              allow users to search through common printer issues and
              resolutions, adding local storage for a better user experience,
              and more not only to support the community, but to also get as
